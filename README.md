# Tic Tac Toe
Coded using the processing Library in Java Eclipse IDE
If you try to use this code in the IDE make sure to include the processing core.jar library which is in the libraries folder
This is the source code for the Jar file that you can download here:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1naKkmEzB0xL7_ppdmodNK5vRlI9BftJ3/view?usp=sharing

Design
I Chose to code this program in java using the p5 processing library because I have used processing for many past projects that have required GUI interfaces such as the game I created “Project Icarus” found here: https://github.com/chun1213/Project-Icarus-master
I also did not want to go overboard and use something like Pygame as tic tac toe is a very simple game to program, the only reason I used processing is because I wanted an easy-to-use graphic library. 
The are 2 main modes to my program, Human and Computer. Human is when your basically play tic tac toe against yourself while computer is when you face an “AI”. This AI is not smart by any means, it will not always play the most logical or best move, in fact it chooses its moves randomly. Sure, I could have made the program use a minmax algorithm to influence the computer’s decisions but that seems like overkill. If you are interested in a minimax algorithm implementation you can look at the source code behind my chess engine here: https://github.com/chun1213/Chess that uses a minimax algorithm in decision making, plus if the computer always chose the best moves, the game would always end in a draw and be boring.
